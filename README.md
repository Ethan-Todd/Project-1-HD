# Home Depot Project 1 Rebuild

This folder is a separate rebuild. Edition A and every original project file outside this folder remain unchanged.

## Current model

- Part 2 status: **complete for implementation; provisional for evidence**
- Valuation date: **September 1, 2026**
- Security: Home Depot common stock (NYSE: HD)
- Currency: USD; statements in USD millions
- Architecture: reported FY2025 → explicit five-year statements → signed FCFF → provisional WACC DCF → enterprise-to-equity bridge
- Current architecture result: **$234.31 per diluted share, provisional**
- Current decision-testing base: **$234.00 per diluted share**; evidence-backed operating range **$220.99–$253.91**
- Current script: `home_depot_fcff_model.py`
- Exact command from the FIN 439 folder:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python home_depot_project_1_rebuild/home_depot_fcff_model.py
```

Part 3 command:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python home_depot_project_1_rebuild/part3_analysis.py
```

That script refreshes `05_part3_visible_output.txt`, so the dated inputs and results can be reviewed without running code.

## Part 1 versus Part 2

- **Part 1:** established the reported FY2025 base, identified the omitted commercial paper, and linked operating forecasts to FCFF. The earlier $207.85 output belonged to that earlier assumption set and is not the current result.
- **Part 2/current:** uses a September 1 valuation basis, explicit working-capital and long-lived-asset schedules, latest public debt/share inputs, and the transparent but still provisional 8.1984% WACC. It produces $234.31.

The WACC change from 8.8% to 8.1984% is the main cause of the increase: it adds $27.45 per share in the sequential reconciliation. The schedule, share, debt, and cash changes net to a $0.99 decrease from $207.85 to $206.86 before the WACC change.

## Part 3 provisional decision

- Operating-case DCF range: **$220.99–$253.91 per diluted share**; scenario base **$234.00**.
- September 1, 2026 close: **$319.77**.
- Comparable references: **$240.00** from trailing GAAP P/E and **$217.21** from trailing GAAP EV/EBITDA. They are not averaged.
- Reverse DCF: **+6.23 percentage points** added uniformly to all five explicit total-growth rates reaches market price with printed inputs fixed.
- Action: **watch-defer**, conditional on price or evidence. WACC remains provisional.

The scenario base differs slightly from Part 2 because FY2026 now uses the midpoint of August 18 guidance and capex/margins are aligned to that evidence. Part 2 remains the architecture checkpoint; Part 3 is the decision-testing layer.

## Integrity boundaries

- Reported FY2025 is reproduced before any normalization.
- No unsupported numeric normalization is embedded.
- Failed required validations make the script exit unsuccessfully.
- Beta, marginal debt cost/tax, excess cash, exact diluted shares, the operating-lease rollforward, and several forecast drivers remain unresolved or provisional.
- No Edition A history, AI-off prediction, partner feedback, timestamp, or validation record has been invented.
