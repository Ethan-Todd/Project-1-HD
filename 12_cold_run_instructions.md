# Fresh-Environment Setup and Cold-Run Checklist

No third-party Python packages are required.

## Repository and project path

- Repository: `https://github.com/Ethan-Todd/Project-1-HD.git`
- Current working source: `/Users/ethantodd/Documents/Codex/2026-08-25/op/FIN 439/home_depot_project_1_rebuild`
- Project path after the clone command below: `HD` (the repository root)

## Reproduce from a fresh clone

```bash
git clone --branch main --single-branch https://github.com/Ethan-Todd/Project-1-HD.git Project-1-HD
cd Project-1-HD
git rev-parse HEAD
python3 -m venv .venv
./.venv/bin/python --version
./.venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
./.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
./.venv/bin/python benchmark_validation.py
echo $?
./.venv/bin/python home_depot_fcff_model.py
echo $?
./.venv/bin/python part3_analysis.py
echo $?
git status --short
```

`requirements.txt` deliberately declares standard-library-only operation, so the requirements installation should add no project packages. The pip upgrade is environment setup, not a model dependency. Windows PowerShell uses `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` instead of `./.venv/bin/python`.

Expected exit status is zero for each script. `benchmark_validation.py` must show twelve PASS lines and `Overall: PASS`; the company model must show the historical, accounting, DCF and bridge checks as PASS; Part 3 must show all three cases and its automated checks as PASS. Part 3 refreshes `05_part3_visible_output.txt`; the benchmark refreshes `14_training_benchmark_output.txt`.

A refresh of the two tracked output files may make `git status --short` nonempty if formatting or environment metadata differs; explain and inspect any difference rather than hiding it.

## Required fresh-clone inventory

Before running, show that the clone contains at least:

- `README.md` and `requirements.txt`;
- `benchmark_validation.py`, `home_depot_fcff_model.py`, and `part3_analysis.py`;
- `edition_a_unchanged.md`;
- `00_architecture_audit.md` through `20_partner_challenge_status.md`, including the visible output and working validation records.

This standalone repository contains only the Project 1 rebuild rather than older unrelated course files. An unrecorded clean-clone verification may establish reproducibility, but it does **not** replace the assignment's recorded cold run; record the final remote `git rev-parse HEAD` shown when you perform it.

## Cold-run recording checklist — not yet completed

**Placement qualification:** the Project 1 assignment language supplied by the student explicitly requires one clean end-to-end fresh-environment run to be recorded. The available shared checklist does not specify whether the complete recording must be embedded in Video 2 or retained as separate validation evidence. It provides no fourth-video manifest row; the validation template includes reproducibility/cold-run evidence, while Video 2 must show how to reproduce output and demonstrate a high-risk test. Confirm the required submission location in Brightspace or with the instructor. Until then, do not claim that a separate fourth video is required or that the entire run must fit inside Video 2.

- [ ] Start recording before opening the repository.
- [ ] Show the repository URL/commit and an actually fresh clone or clean environment.
- [ ] Show `python3 --version`; record operating system and architecture.
- [ ] Create the virtual environment without installing packages.
- [ ] Run the benchmark; show all twelve comparisons and exit status.
- [ ] Run the core company model; show FY2025 reconciliation, linked statements, bridge and checks.
- [ ] Run Part 3; show the three cases, sensitivity, reverse DCF, comps and checks.
- [ ] Show that `05_part3_visible_output.txt` and `14_training_benchmark_output.txt` were refreshed.
- [ ] Record the first failure exactly, if any, and the resolution or scoped limitation.
- [ ] Show one deliberate failure/boundary test and its unsuccessful status or invalid result.
- [ ] Keep visible: all twelve benchmark PASS lines; FY2025/base reconciliation; five-year balance and cash-tie checks; three operating cases; DCF bridge; sensitivity/reverse DCF; comparable references; recommendation and limitations.
- [ ] Confirm no credentials or private data are present.
- [ ] Record run date/time, commit hash, commands, exit codes, and video timestamp indices.
- [ ] Correct transcript terms and numbers after recording.

Do not check these boxes merely because the scripts ran in the development environment. The assignment requires a recorded cold run in a fresh environment.
