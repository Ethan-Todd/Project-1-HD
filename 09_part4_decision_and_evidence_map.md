# Part 4 — Decision Explanation and Evidence Map

## Why the action is watch/defer

The committee holds no Home Depot position. The September 1, 2026 close of **$319.77** is above the operating-scenario DCF range of **$220.99–$253.91**, the **$240.00** P/E reference, and the **$217.21** EV/EBITDA reference. Because the operating cases and two-peer comparisons are still affected by provisional WACC, dilution, cash, and peer evidence, the analysis supports neither immediate initiation nor a falsely certain “overvalued” claim; it supports watching for a better entry price or evidence of stronger organic growth and operating leverage.

The downside case produces **$220.99**, widening the shortfall to market. It does not change watch/defer by itself because the current action already avoids initiation. For an entry decision, it raises the required margin of safety: a price decline is not sufficient if the decline is accompanied by operating evidence that moves the forecast toward or below the downside path.

## Operating range versus WACC sensitivity

- **Operating-scenario range ($220.99–$253.91):** linked downside/base/upside business paths. Organic demand, acquisition/new-unit contribution, gross margin, SG&A efficiency, and capex move together for stated economic reasons. WACC and terminal growth stay fixed. This is the provisional decision range.
- **WACC–terminal-growth sensitivity ($177.82–$330.03 across the displayed grid):** a valuation-boundary table applied to the base FCFF path. It changes discount/terminal assumptions without changing operations. Its corners are not probabilities or additional operating cases and are not substituted for the decision range.

At the lowest displayed WACC and highest terminal growth, sensitivity reaches $330.03, above market. That does not justify initiation because the 7.20% WACC and 3.0% terminal growth combination has not been established as the evidence-backed base.

## Reconciliation: $234.31 Part 2 to $234.00 Part 3 base

WACC, terminal growth, bridge debt, excess cash, and diluted shares are unchanged. The difference is a sequential operating-assumption update:

| Sequential step | Value/share | Change from prior step |
|---|---:|---:|
| Part 2 operating inputs | $234.308875 | — |
| Part 3 total-growth path | $237.390142 | +$3.081267 |
| Part 3 gross-margin path | $237.075506 | −$0.314636 |
| Part 3 SG&A/gross-profit path | $236.877042 | −$0.198464 |
| Part 3 capex path | **$233.996269** | −$2.880773 |

Net change: **−$0.312606 per share**, displayed as $234.31 to $234.00. The higher guidance-aligned 2026 growth adds value, but the 33.1% near-term gross margin, slight SG&A deleverage, and $4.2bn annual capex more than offset it.

## Published training-case benchmark identified

The required files were available locally at `course-materials/lessons/week-03/starter/dcf_case.csv` and `dcf_expected_output.csv`; no user-supplied answer key was needed.

Inputs: starting FCFF **$100m**; annual growth **8%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%**; WACC **10%**; terminal growth **3%**; non-operating cash **$50m**; debt **$300m**; diluted shares **50m**. Convention: annual year-end FCFF, five explicit years, Gordon terminal value at Year 5, discounted five years.

Expected answers: Year 1–5 FCFF **108.000000, 114.480000, 120.204000, 125.012160, 128.762525**; explicit FCFF PV **448.440817**; terminal value at Year 5 **1,894.648579**; terminal-value PV **1,176.427703**; enterprise value **1,624.868520**; common equity value **1,374.868520**; value/share **27.497370**; terminal-value share **0.724014**. The saved benchmark reproduces all twelve within the published tolerances.
